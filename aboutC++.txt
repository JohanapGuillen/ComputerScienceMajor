C++ was developed by a Danish computer scientist known as Bjarne Stroucstrup. 
C++ is objected programming developed by making certain changes and improvements on C.
It adds object-oriented features to C. The first C++ compiler was Cfront, but as the name suggests,
it was only a front-end compiler. Originally c++ was named "C with classes" but was changed in 1983 
to its current name, demonstrating the incrementation from C to C++. It's designed to have qualities
of C such as its speed but comes with its own high-level properties. The downside this language is 
that it's a little harder to learn for beginners in coding and the code itself takes up more time then 
code in languages such as python take. With the updates developed for C++, came multiple compilers 
proven to be useful such as Turbo C++ compiler. The language itself though, has been modified multiple
times with C++20 being the most updated version and C++23 being in the works. An interesting feature
of C++ is its multiple inheritance feature that allows classes to inherit from more than one class.
